The current code for my F1 website project, f1observer.com â€” featuring live countdowns to events as well as presenting driver stats. Also using the Ergast API to provide past championship seasons' standings. I may update the website itself in the future, but most likely won't update the github repository.

Place countdown targets in index.js beginning portion
Place driver points, etc. into drivers.json

npm run build (webpack)
npm run dev (local server, webpack serve)

Building src folder's index.js into dist --> bundle.js
